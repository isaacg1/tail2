1. T > c policy:
  a. Analysis:
     j of size x has:
     If W_j + x < c: T_j = W_j + x
     else:           T_j <= T_j^SRPT + c
     i. To theoretically analyze this, we need T_j^SRPT conditionied on W_j.
  b. Simulation :)
2. Simulate lots of policies, lots of metrics. Both percentile aware and percentle unaware.
3. Lower bound:
  a. Tardiness:
     i. Minimum number tardy at any point in time in any policy. 2-3x better than best online found.
        A. Faster?
4. SOAP hybrid: Not particularly impressive :)
