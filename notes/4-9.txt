I have the 3 part bound.
If W_j < c - x: T_j = W_j + x
If Wait_j^{SRPT}_x < c: T_j <= T^{SRPT}_x (This one doesn't happen much, but now we know)
Else: T_j <= c + T_j^{SRPT}
If the metric only cares about mean (e.g. Tardiness), then we can replace the last bound with:
Else: T_j <= c + T_{ss}^{SRPT}
this isn't much better, but it's easier to analyze.
